# Photoshop Plugin Starter

This is a basic environment written in CMake for Photoshop plug-in development.
[PhotoShop SDK](https://console.adobe.io/downloads/ps) is not included. (*Just in case, licensing issue.*) You can find how to download it through more information.

Unfortunately, it doesn't support macOS yet. ~~Because I don't have a mac...ðŸ˜¥~~
